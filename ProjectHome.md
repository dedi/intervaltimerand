# An Interval Timer for Android. #

## Overview ##

A trivial, but useful (if you need such a thing) interval timer. Written because I had some use for such a timer.

More free stuff can be found on my site, [xomzom.com](http://www.xomzom.com)


## Installation ##
It's not on the android market (for now, anyway). You can [download the prebuilt package](http://code.google.com/p/intervaltimerand/downloads/detail?name=TimerApp-release.apk), or build one yourself


## Issues ##
I am not aware of any. Please report anything you find http://code.google.com/p/intervaltimerand/issues/list here, and I'll try to fix it.


## Building From Source ##
The project can be built using the build.xml ant script on the root directory. You'll need the [android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). A debug version can be built by typing `ant debug`. To build a release version, you'll also need your own key. See http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/other-ide.html for more information on building android projects.
Building from Eclipse probably works as well, but I haven't tried it on machines other than my own.
